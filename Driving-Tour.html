                <p>Heading South toward Sebastopol on Hwy 116 you might consider picking up a few delicious snacks at our unique <b>Andy’s</b> Fruit Market.</p>

                <p>As you continue West out of Sebastopol, Hwy 12 takes you through the coastal foothill communities and into the town of <b>Bodega</b>. If you are familiar with Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds”; you will see the church and the schoolhouse as you pass thru. Continuing West, you will enter the eclectic fishing village of Bodega Bay.</p>

                <p>There are some nice restaurants along the Hwy 1, but we like to hop over to the other side of the bay and enjoy the <b>Crab Shack</b>. It’s just crab, anyway you like it.</p>

                <p>If you continue just ¼ mile up the road you are at <b>Bodega Head</b>. This amazing point was once considered for a nuclear power plant. It has a network of walking paths and dramatic views from the cliffs. Even a short walk is exhilarating and well worth it if you have the time.</p>

                <p>From here, backtrack over to Hwy 1 and head North towards Jenner. There are a number of <b>beaches</b> that you can visit. Please check the Sonoma County Parks website. Please remember, this is rugged Northern California coastline. Each beach has its own unique location/accessibility information.</p>

                <p>If you continue just a bit North past the town of Jenner there are some beautiful pull outs at the top that give you a view of the <b>Russian River</b> mouth and Seal Beach. River’s End Restaurant at the top is a landmark to look for a pull out.</p>

                <p>The last leg of the drive is Hwy 116 back to Forestville. You will go through a number of fun and funky river towns and cross the Russian River a few times. Guerneville has Johnson Beach and lots of interesting <b>shops and restaurants</b>. Once you leave Guerneville it is just under 9 miles/15 minutes back to Forestville.</p>
